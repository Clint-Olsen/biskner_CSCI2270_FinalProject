# biskner_CSCI2270_FinalProject
My final project will be a text adventure game in the vein of Zork. Specifically, it will place the user as a valiant hero in the mystical scape of CU Balderdash, where they must collect items and explore areas in order to beat a final boss. I will use the data structures we learned over the semester to implement this project. For example, I will create the game world with a graph; I will build the hero with a class, and I will construct an inventory with a linked list (or vector). 

Project Summary:
My final project is a text adventure game. In it, you are an apprecntice training in computer wizardry, and for your final examination you must defeat the evil troll COG. In order to do so you will need to explore the map to collect weapons, unlock areas, and find your missing spellbook. The project itself functions by allowing a hero object and a gamMap object (linked list) to interact in a main.cpp file. 

How to Run:
In order to run you will need a functioning VM and codeblocks program. Start by linking all the files together under the project->build options dropdown, and be sure to add all the .h files under the project->build options->search directories. Finally, make sure that under project->build options you have the project follow -std=c++11.

Open Issues/ Bugs:
I believe most of the bugs have been fixed; however, if you get the item "Protein of Whey" you can receive unlimited health bonuses by equipping and reequipping it. This was intentional to make the final boss easier, though it may seem like a bug at first.
