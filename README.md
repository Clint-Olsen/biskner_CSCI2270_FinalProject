# biskner_CSCI2270_FinalProject
My final project will be a text adventure game in the vein of Zork. Specifically, it will place the user as a valiant hero in the mystical scape of CU Balderdash, where they must collect items and explore areas in order to beat a final boss. I will use the data structures we learned over the semester to implement this project. For example, I will create the game world with a graph; I will build the hero with a class, and I will construct an inventory with a linked list (or vector).
